## Install
  * After extracting the rar file just right click on the folder called 'gitUsers' while holding shift key.
  * Select 'open command window here', or any other cli you prefer.
  * Run 'ng serve' command, of course that's an 'angular cli' command so you need to make sure that 'angular cli' is installed, as well as 'nodeJs' and 'npm'. I'm sure you're aware of that, but I prefered to mention it anyway.
  * Open your browser and go for the url : 'localhost:4200/'
  * Also you can run the same command from within the folder called 'dist' found in 'gitUsers/dist'
