## Install
  * After extracting the rar file just right click on the folder called 'gitUsers' while holding shift key.
  * Select 'open command window here', or any other cli you prefer.
  * Run 'ng serve' command, of course that's an 'angular cli' command so you need to make sure that 'angular cli' is installed, as well as 'nodeJs' and 'npm'. I'm sure you're aware of that, but I prefered to mention it anyway.
  * Open your browser and go for the url : 'localhost:4200/'
  * Also you can run the same command from within the folder called 'dist' found in 'gitUsers/dist'

## Requirements to run the application
  * nodejs - found here: https://nodejs.org/en/
  * npm - found here: https://www.npmjs.com
  * angular cli - found here https://github.com/angular/angular-cli

## Notes:
  * You'll find that the task folder contains the 'node_modules' folder, as I found that after compressing the folder, it became nearly 35MBs, so it's not that big to upload.
  * I read little from the css guidelines you sent along with other guidelines, but I beleive that my code is readable, but I plan to read and apply them to enhance my code, I just didn't want to be late to deleiver the task.
